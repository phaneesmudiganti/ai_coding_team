Build a microservice that exposes a REST API for:
- CRUD for Projects and Tasks
- Task scheduling and status tracking
- SQLite persistence
- CLI to seed sample data
- Unit tests for service layer and API endpoints
- Containerization guidance in README
- Write the file app.py to create the entrypoint and run the generated application
Non-functional:
- Logging, input validation
- Clean boundaries: models, repository, service, api
